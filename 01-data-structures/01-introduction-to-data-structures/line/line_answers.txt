1: How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
    Data can be added to the array at the end, but any index is able to be removed in any order.
    
2: If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
    The code loops over itself to check if the element is at that particular position, if the element isn't there it moves one up until it is found.

3: What other real-world data can each structure represent?
    It can represent a row of books in order of when they are to be read, a list of products you are waiting to buy, or any other thing where it calls for one single element after another.
