1. This in using insertion sort that has a O(n^2)
2. I used counting sort that has a O(n+k) to test it out, however I would normally use quicksort which is O(n^2) the same as insertion sort but its average is better.
3. Doesn't insertion sort already have a time complexity of O(1)? I reworked this to use the built in sort method in ruby which uses quicksort.
