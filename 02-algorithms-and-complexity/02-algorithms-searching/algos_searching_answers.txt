3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
fib(10) >  fib(10 - 2) + fib(10 - 1) = 21 + 34 = 55
fib(11) >  fib(11 - 2) + fib(11 - 1) = 34 + 55 = 89
fib(12) >  fib(12 - 2) + fib(12 - 1) = 55 + 89 = 144

recursive
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.001297)
iterative 
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000004)
  
Iteration is faster

1. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your resoning.
I would choose to use iteration linear as it is faster for unsorted collections.

2.Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
I would use iterative binary, as it is sorted and binary seaches are great for that.
